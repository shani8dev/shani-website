        <h2 class="section-title">Why Choose Shanios</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center; max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto 3rem;">
          A next-generation immutable operating system built on Arch Linux that truly never breaks. Revolutionary blue-green deployment with Btrfs subvolumes ensures atomic updates and instant rollback. The custom shani-deploy tool orchestrates updates with military precision—downloading verified images, applying configurations, generating unified kernel images, and validating everything before switching. Professional tools included, but the real innovation is the architecture that makes system failures literally impossible.
        </p>

            <h3>Blue-Green Deployment</h3>
            <p class="feature-snippet">
              Two complete system images (@blue and @green) using Btrfs subvolumes. Updates apply to the inactive image while you work. DevOps-proven strategy adapted for desktop use.
            </p>

            <div class="feature-details hidden">
              <p>
                Shanios uses <strong>blue-green deployment architecture</strong> with two complete system images (@blue and @green) implemented as Btrfs subvolumes. While you use one image, updates install to the other. After verification, a simple reboot switches to the updated image atomically.
              </p>
              <p>
                The custom <strong>shani-deploy tool</strong> orchestrates the entire process—downloading verified images, applying configurations via overlays, generating new unified kernel images, updating the bootloader, and validating everything before switching. Updates are applied to the inactive system copy, meaning your current working environment is never at risk.
              </p>
              <p>
                This dual-image design eliminates mid-update failures entirely. If verification fails, the update never applies. Your active system remains untouched and fully functional throughout the entire update process. This brings datacenter-grade reliability to the desktop.

              <p>
                <strong>Immutable system core:</strong> Root filesystem (/) mounted read-only, preventing system corruption, malware modifications, and configuration drift while maintaining maximum performance. The system partition ensures absolute stability.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>/etc as overlay filesystem:</strong> Persistent configuration changes without breaking immutability. <strong>/var managed with systemd.volatile=state</strong> for optimized state management. <strong>User applications via Flatpak</strong> for complete isolation. <strong>Mutable /home</strong> for user data and configurations.
              </p>
              <p>
                This sophisticated architecture provides the perfect balance of immutability and flexibility, allowing necessary customization while keeping the core system protected and reliable.

                Both system images (blue and green) remain intact and bootable at all times. If anything goes wrong after an update, select the previous image from the boot menu. The switch is instant—rollback completes in under a minute, just a reboot away.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Zero downtime updates:</strong> System updates happen in the background on the inactive partition. Reboot to switch partitions, and if anything goes wrong, reboot again to instantly return to your previous working state. No interruption to your workflow.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your personal files, settings, and applications persist across both images using shared storage. Only the system core rolls back, giving you the best of both worlds: instant recovery without losing your work or data.

          Installing Shanios takes about 20 minutes. Everything you need to know is here.
        </p>
        
        <div class="install-content">
          <h3>System Requirements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> 32 GB minimum for blue-green dual-image architecture (64 GB recommended)</li>
            <li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM minimum (8 GB recommended)</li>
            <li><strong>Processor:</strong> 64-bit x86 CPU with virtualization support (Intel VT-x or AMD-V)</li>
            <li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA (all drivers included)</li>
            <li><strong>Installation Media:</strong> 8 GB or larger USB drive</li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>Note: The blue-green architecture requires two complete system images, which is why minimum storage is higher than typical Linux distributions. This dual-image design is what makes atomic updates and instant recovery possible.</em></p>

          <h3>Pre-Installation: BIOS/UEFI Setup</h3>
          <p>Configure firmware before installing (access via <kbd>F2</kbd>, <kbd>F10</kbd>, <kbd>Del</kbd>, or <kbd>Esc</kbd> at startup):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Disable Fast Boot</li>
            <li>Disable Secure Boot (required for installation—can be re-enabled after enrolling Shanios keys)</li>
            <li>Set SATA mode to AHCI</li>
            <li>Enable UEFI boot (disable legacy/CSM)</li>
            <li>Enable virtualization (Intel VT-x or AMD-V)</li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>Note: If you want to use Secure Boot, you can re-enable it after installation and enroll the Shanios signing key using MOK (Machine Owner Key) management.</em></p>

          <h3>Creating Installation Media</h3>
          <p>Write ISO to USB using <strong>Balena Etcher</strong> (recommended, cross-platform), <strong>Rufus</strong> (Windows), or <strong>dd</strong> (Linux/Mac).</p>
          <p><strong>Important:</strong> Do not use Ventoy—it has known compatibility issues with Shanios's immutable architecture and bootloader configuration.</p>

          <h3>Installation Steps</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Boot from USB (press <kbd>F12</kbd>, <kbd>F2</kbd>, or <kbd>Del</kbd> during startup)</li>
            <li>Select "Install Shanios" from boot menu</li>
            <li>Choose language, timezone, and keyboard layout</li>
            <li>Select disk and partitioning scheme (automatic recommended)</li>
            <li>Enable LUKS2 full-disk encryption if desired (recommended for laptops)</li>
            <li>Wait for installation to complete (10-15 minutes)</li>
            <li>Reboot when prompted (remove USB drive)</li>
          </ol>
          <p><em>Note: Desktop environment (GNOME or KDE Plasma) is determined by which ISO you downloaded.</em></p>

          <h3>Initial Setup (First Boot)</h3>
          <p>On first boot, the <strong>Initial Setup wizard</strong> will guide you through:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Creating your user account (username and password)</li>
            <li>Configuring network connections</li>
            <li>Setting up privacy and location services</li>
            <li>Finalizing system preferences</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This approach allows the base system to install quickly while personalizing your setup on first boot.</p>

          <h3>System Updates</h3>
          <p><strong>Immutable system updates:</strong></p>
          <pre><code>sudo shani-deploy</code></pre>
          <p>Updates apply atomically to the inactive image. After reboot, you boot into the updated system. If needed, you can select the previous image from the boot menu.</p>

          <p><strong>Application updates:</strong></p>
          <pre><code>flatpak update</code></pre>

          <p><strong>Firmware updates:</strong></p>
          <pre><code>fwupdmgr update</code></pre>
          <p>Delivered via LVFS using <code>fwupd</code>.</p>
          <p><strong>Important:</strong> Always use <code>shani-deploy</code> for system updates to preserve immutability.</p>

          <h3>Important Notes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Dual booting:</strong> Not recommended—other OSes may break the bootloader</li>
            <li><strong>Package management:</strong> Use Flatpak, containers, or AppImages</li>
            <li><strong>System modifications:</strong> Root filesystem is immutable—use proper channels</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Boot:</strong> Can be enabled after installation by enrolling MOK keys (password: <code>shanios</code>)</li>
          </ul>

        <p>
          Created by <strong>Shrinivas Vishnu Kumbhar</strong> during M.Tech research
          at <a href="https://www.walchandsangli.ac.in" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
          Walchand College of Engineering, Sangli</a>.

        <p>
          Shanios is built with a simple belief:
          <strong>your operating system should never break.</strong> It should be your most reliable tool — not a source of anxiety.
          Shanios proves that security, usability, and reliability can coexist.
